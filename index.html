                <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
                
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. 
                    it is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. 
                    JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these 
                    environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><a href="http://www.javascriptisawesome.com/VariableDeclaration.html">Variable Declaration:</a> Javascript variables are containers 
                        for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript 
                        variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="bluetext">var x;</span></p></li>
                    <li><p><a href="http://www.javascriptisawesome.com/VariableAssignment.html">Variable Assignment:</a> Assignment operatiors assign values to 
                        JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. the = assignment operator 
                        assigns a value to a variable. <span class="bluetext"> var x = 10;</span></p></li>
                    <li><p><a href="http://www.javascriptisawesome.com/DataTypes.html">Data Types:</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to 
                        operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - 
                        <span class="bluetext">true</span> or <span class="bluetext">false</span>; null - <span class="bluetext">null</span> aka nothing; 
                        Number - <span class="bluetext">42</span> or <span class="bluetext">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="bluetext">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";
                            </span> Array - <span class="bluetext">[1, "Coding", 2 "Dojo"];</span> and Object - <span class="bluetext">{first_name: "Jane", last_name: "Doe"}</span></p></li>
                    <li><p><a href="http://www.javascriptisawesome.com/Conditionals.html">Conditionals:</a> When you write code, you want to perform different 
                        actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional 
                        statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class="bluetext">if</span> a specified 
                        condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="bluetext">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first 
                        condition is false; <span class="bluetext">else</span> we execute this block of code;</p></li>
                    <li><p><a href="http://www.javascriptisawesome.com/Loops.html">Loops:</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, 
                        but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run 
                        around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!</p></li>
                    <li><p><a href="http://www.javascriptisawesome.com/Functions.html">Functions:</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our 
                        function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from 
                        Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way 
                        up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</p></li>
